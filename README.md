# Philadelphia

Philadelphia is a low latency Financial Information Exchange (FIX) engine for
the JVM.

You can use Philadelphia to connect to stock exchanges, brokerage firms, and
other network endpoints that use the FIX protocol. You can also use it to
provide your own services using the FIX protocol.

Philadelphia is designed to exhibit low and predictable latency. To achieve
this, it supports non-blocking, zero-copy networking and does not allocate
any memory on message reception or transmission. It can achieve [7.7 Âµs
round-trip time (RTT)](examples/initiator) over the loopback interface.

Philadelphia requires Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8 or newer.
